Based on total market, optimistic

<Bottom Up> Estimate using current similar products's sales data 用目前類似產品銷售狀況來預測
比如說對手有10000個使用者 10%下載你的產品 每人花5美元 你可以賺到5000美元

24.Mastering pricing strategies

<Pricing strategy>
Three main types:
Cost based
Demand based
Competition based

<Cost based pricing>
What does it cost to make/supply?
Add a bit for profit
Charge that price

<Demand based pricing>
What would they pay?
Know your customers and what their value gained is


<Competition based pricing>
What is everyone else charging?
Charge slightly less then them, or be different
Choose a niche

<Elasticity of Demand>
Inelastic market
- Customers buy regardless of price
- Therefore charge a lot!
- Luxuries ... and essentials

Elastic market
- Customers choose cheapest option,
Or only buy when the price does down
- Large items which normal ppl buy


<Elasticity of Demand>
Is the product an essential or a luxury?
Is it related to health or safety? If yes, inelastic market, charge more
Are there substitutes available?
Where is the product in its life-cycle?
What type of buyer is buying it?
How 'perfect' is the market? Everyone knows the price?
Barriers to entry preventing new suppliers coming in and increasing supply

<Pricing tactics>
Short term changes within your overall strategy
Experimental pricing 將價格實驗性地提高試試看
Loss leader pricing 將價格暫時降低以搶市場 用低價吸引人來買別的東西
Psychological pricing 99 比 100 吸引人 
Perceived value pricing 提高價錢以看起來高級
Complimentary goods pricing 利用補充品來賺錢 例如賣服務或墨水 (service makes money)
Product life pricing 產品剛出來時較高價

25.Summing up with SWOT

Follow recommendations vs reviews vs staff 因為網路推薦買 因為評論買 還是因為員工推薦
Motivated by security vs status vs savings 為了安全 還是目前狀態 還是為了要省錢
Promote the weakest feature? 如果大部分的功能都知道了 是否有其他微小的動機可促銷


<5M's of Advertising>
