[SWOT Analysis]
lets analysts consider the alignment of strengths and weaknesses with opportunities and threats

[Balanced Scorecards]
consider multiple components in assessing organizational performance
- Financial performance

[Business Model Canvases]
illustrate how value is created and exchanged between the organization and customers from a variety of perspectives
