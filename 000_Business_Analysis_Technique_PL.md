work together to meet a
predefined objective
Workshops may be useful in
defining how organizational goals
may best be reached
1. May be useful during any
phase of a change initiative
2. Workshops that are facilitated and
documented are most effective
3. Participants should be clear on goals
and objectives of the workshop
4. Remaining questions, open work items,
and next steps should be captured and
distributed after the workshop
(+)
Useful structure for stakeholder
collaboration and consensus building
Immediate feedback and discussion
allows for quick iteration
(-)
Coordinating participation of all
necessary stakeholders may be difficult
Right stakeholders must be involved

impair effectiveness

[Focus Groups]
Opportunity to gather
perspectives from participants
in a moderated setting
Moderator fosters discussion
among participants, unlike in a
group interview where responses are less collaborative
1. Small groups of 6-12
participants tend to work best
2. Participants should be carefully
selected, and encouraged to share
their perspectives
3. Crucial that moderator has training
and skill in facilitating focus groups
4. Important to capture focus group
results immediately or in real-time
(+)

[Interviews]
Allow for the elicitation of
information from one or several
stakeholders through conversation
<Structured interviews> involve asking
stakeholders predefined questions
<Unstructured interviews> are free-ranging and
evolve based on stakeholder responses
Most successful interviews involve a hybrid
Interviews approach to asking questions

Interview goals and purpose should be
established and shared in advance
Selection of stakeholders to interview is
important to ensuring a productive outcome
Interviews involve a variety of logistical factors
Analyst must actively manage the interview to
ensure the conversation yields value
Follow-up to share, clarify, validate, or expand
upon information may be required
(+)
Well-conducted interviews help build
relationships with stakeholders and
foster support for change initiatives
Ideal technique for dynamically eliciting
information, inclusive of sensitive topics
(-)
Requires time and commitment

given the objectives and types of data sets
in question
(+)
Discovery of patterns and trends can lead
to invaluable insights
Data analysis can confirm and strengthen
the case for change initiatives
(-)
Easy to misapply techniques and misunderstand
results of analysis
Results must be converted into a format that
makes them actionable and understandable by
stakeholders lacking technical knowledge

[Document Analysis]
Allows analyst to find critical
information and context through
review of documents
Contextualizes organizational
performance, footing, and
objectives

1. Analyst must identify which documents
may merit analysis
2. May include internal documents as well as
external sources of interest
3. Analyst must determine whether
documented information is relevant,
accurate, and timely enough to utilize
4. Gaps in information and conflicts between
sources must be identified
5. Creating new assets, including visual aids, from
existing documentation may be helpful in
conveying information to stakeholders

solution value and compare
alternatives before recommending
a specific course of action
[Prototyping]
1. [Proof of concept]
Useful for validating system design, without full
fidelity of appearance or functionality
2. [Form study]
Allows aesthetic aspects of systems to be
considered separate from creation of functionality
3. [Usability
prototype]

working model to ensure requirements are met
[Prototyping]
1. Storyboarding
2. Paper prototyping
3. Workflow modeling
4. Simulation
(+)
Visual nature of most prototypes allows
stakeholders to envision completed
solutions while providing feedback
Solution gaps and technical challenges
may be discovered through prototyping
(-)
High-fidelity prototypes may require an
undue amount of effort to create
Focus on visual aspects of solutions may
inhibit discussion and development of
underlying system functionality

23 Modeling Solutions in Organizational Context
[Modeling Solutions in Organizational Context]

[Organizational Modeling]
Describes roles and related
reporting structures that define
an organization’s composition
Focuses on titles and
responsibilities, not individuals

[Organizational Modeling]
Organizational charts don’t account for
informal power structures and political
dynamics within organizations
Supplementing organizational
modeling with an understanding of
who holds “influencer” status improves
the BA’s understanding of how work is
accomplished
(+)
Commonly used, so typically easy to
obtain and leverage
Beneficial for traceability, oversight, and
retrospective purposes
(-)
May not be entirely up to date
Will not depict informal authority and
influence dynamics within the
organization

[Financial Analysis]
Improves understanding of cost
and return on investment related
to solution options
Helps in validating the business
case for action to be taken

1. Total cost of ownership factors in initial
and ongoing costs related to change
2. Cost-benefit analysis allows alternatives
to be compared to one another
3. Return on investment calculates the
percentage yield compared to cost
4. Net present value allows benefits to be
understood within the context of time
5. Internal rate of return indicates what interest
rate represents breakeven for a solution
(+)
Allows for objective comparison of
otherwise dissimilar alternatives
Models may be updated to account for
revised estimates or replacement of
assumptions with actual numbers
(-)
Benefits and costs incurred by
organizations undertaking change
initiatives are not just financial in nature
Opportunity cost is not always wellconsidered
in financial analysis

24 Defining and Gauging Initiative Success
[Defining and Gauging Initiative Success]

[Estimation]
Allows analysts to forecast the
time, cost, and resources that
would be required to undertake
components of the change
initiative
1. Analogous Estimation
2. Parametric Estimation

[Triangular Distribution
Method]
Weights optimistic, pessimistic,
and most likely scenarios equally
•cE = Cost expected
•cO = Optimistic cost estimate
•cM = Most likely cost estimate
•cP = Pessimistic cost estimate
cE=(cO + cM + cP)/3

[PERT Method]
Weights most likely scenario
more heavily than optimistic
or pessimistic possibilities
•cE = Cost expected
•cO = Optimistic cost estimate
•cM = Most likely cost estimate
•cP = Pessimistic cost estimate
cE=(cO + 4cM + cP)/6

[Estimation]
(+)
Pivotal to understanding the expected
cost/benefit of any change initiative
May continue to be updated over time to
validate requirements remain aligned
with organizational objectives
(-)
Estimates based on poor inputs or in
cases where many unknown factors
remain may result in high variance
Limiting estimation to a single method
may lead to poor results

[Metrics & KPIs]
Indicate how a solution is
performing, and how that
performance compares to
expectations
Useful in analyzing the current state of scope under consideration
1. <Clear>
Stakeholders should understand what is being
measured, and what those measures indicate
2. <Timely>
Performance indications must be cataloged
often enough and recently enough to be useful
3. <Resourcelight>
Collection of performance data should not be costly
or burdensome, ideally integrated into the process
at a deep level
4. <Sufficient>
Measures taken must provide inherent value and
not require speculation or extrapolation
5. <Quantifiable>
Numerical values must be captured so that
comparison to targets can be objective and
unambiguous in nature
6. <Credible>
The process used to collect data must be trusted,
and the targets used for comparison must be
supported by stakeholder consensus
(+)
Empower organizations to verify
solutions are providing the value
outlined in their business cases

Right balance must be struck between
measuring what matters and not
obstructing performance
Metrics must be thoughtfully designed to
ensure they truly represent performance

processes are performing against
internally-created metrics or
industry competitors
Useful in analyzing the current
state of organizational solutions
1. May help in identifying better
processes used elsewhere
2. May help bolster the business
case for action to be taken
3. Can be helpful in setting goals and
understanding optimal outcomes
4. Leverage a mix of internal and
external data
(+)
Help organizations discover best
practices throughout their industry

[Acceptance & Evaluation Criteria]
Outline what criteria must be met
for solution components to be
accepted by key stakeholders
Critical to address before moving
into active work on solution
development
1. Value attributes define measurable
attributes of performance
2. Consensus between stakeholders regarding
acceptance criteria must be reached
3. Solution value ranking may be used
when multiple solutions are evaluated
4. Acceptance criteria must be testable in order
to confirm whether they have been met
(+)
Makes solution-related priorities clear
Provides a mechanism for validating
requirements
Ensures common understanding of
expected change initiative outcomes
(-)
May not be easy to gauge solution
benefits immediately upon completion
May be difficult to revise if criteria are
also used for contractual purposes

[Vendor Assessment]
Indicates whether a vendor can
meet, or has met, commitments
related to change initiatives
Allows for ranking of vendors to
determine which an organization
may choose to contract with
1. <Expertise>: Does the vendor have sufficient knowledge and
experience to fulfill their role?
2. <Pricing>: How is vendor pricing structured? How does total
cost of ownership compare to other vendors and
internal development?
3. <Market position>:
What is the vendor’s stature within their industry
and how might that impact collaboration?
4. <Terms & conditions>:
What legal parameters may exist regarding
collaboration with the vendor?
5. <Reputation & stability>:
How satisfied have former customers been? What
track record might the vendor have with the
organization? Can the vendor be relied upon?
[Vendor Assessment]
(+)
Helps the organization ensure they
understand when contracting out work
makes sense, and select the best
possible partners
Useful in retrospective instances
(-)
Does not eliminate the possibility of
collaboration going poorly
Susceptible to subjective bias

[Item Tracking]
Maintains awareness and allocates
responsibility for solution-related
issues
Useful for identifying existing
issues that new initiatives may address

<Unique ID>
<Issue summary>
<Type and category>
<Issue status>
<Projected impact>
<Priority level>
<Identifying party>
<Owning party>
<Resolving party>
<Resolution strategy>
<Relevant updates>
<Escalation options>

[Item Tracking]
(+)
Provides a process for issues to be
followed and to ensure they’re addressed
Creates an opportunity for prioritization
of issue handling to be discussed
(-)
Spending too much time and effort on
simply tracking items may distract from
handling them

[Lessons Learned]
Serve as a resource for analysts to
learn from, and to leave behind as
an asset for future initiatives
Reviewing past lessons learned
can guide the early stages of
strategic analysis
1. Captured through retrospective
sessions involving stakeholders
2. Identify what worked, what
didn’t, and underlying causes
3. May focus on business analysis efforts,
change initiatives, or end result of work
4. Useful at milestones or phase gates
in addition to the end of initiatives
(+)
May indicate areas for additional
improvement on new solution
Improve future performance and
reduce future risk
(-)
Require an honest and open
assessment of performance
Documentation must be created and
accessibility must be maintained
